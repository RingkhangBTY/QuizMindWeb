      "question": "Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism intelligently configures your application. What is the primary method Spring Boot uses to determine which auto-configurations to apply?",
      "optionA": "It reads a predefined list of required configurations from the `pom.xml` file.",
      "optionB": "It dynamically scans the classpath for specific starter dependencies and their associated conditional classes.",
      "optionC": "It relies solely on the `@Configuration` classes explicitly defined by the developer.",
      "optionD": "It inspects the environment variables at application startup to decide necessary features.",
      "answer": "It dynamically scans the classpath for specific starter dependencies and their associated conditional classes.",
      "explanation": "Spring Boot auto-configuration works by detecting specific classes on the classpath, often brought in by 'starter' dependencies. Based on the presence or absence of these classes, conditional annotations (like `@ConditionalOnClass`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`) enable or disable auto-configuration classes, rather than relying on `pom.xml` or just explicit developer configurations."
    },
    {
      "question": "The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a convenience annotation that combines several others. Which one of the following annotations is *not* a direct meta-annotation or an implicit component of `@SpringBootApplication`?",
      "optionA": "`@Configuration`",
      "optionB": "`@EnableAutoConfiguration`",
      "optionC": "`@ComponentScan`",
      "optionD": "`@EnableDiscoveryClient`",
      "answer": "`@EnableDiscoveryClient`",
      "explanation": "`@SpringBootApplication` is composed of `@SpringBootConfiguration` (which itself is meta-annotated with `@Configuration`), `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`. `@EnableDiscoveryClient` is part of Spring Cloud for service registration and discovery functionality and is not included in the core Spring Boot application annotation."
    },
    {
      "question": "A Spring Boot application contains `application.properties` and `application-dev.properties` in its `src/main/resources` folder. If the application is launched without explicitly activating any Spring profile (e.g., neither `dev` nor `prod`), how will these property files be loaded and resolved?",
      "optionA": "Only `application-dev.properties` will be loaded, as it implicitly takes precedence in development environments.",
      "optionB": "Only `application.properties` will be loaded; `application-dev.properties` will be ignored.",
      "optionC": "Both files will be loaded, with `application-dev.properties` overriding common properties defined in `application.properties`.",
      "optionD": "Both files will be loaded, but only properties unique to `application-dev.properties` will be added to those from `application.properties`.",
      "answer": "Only `application.properties` will be loaded; `application-dev.properties` will be ignored.",
      "explanation": "By default, `application.properties` (or `application.yaml`) is always loaded. Profile-specific files like `application-dev.properties` are only loaded and take precedence over `application.properties` *if* the corresponding profile (`dev` in this case) is explicitly activated. Without an active profile, `application-dev.properties` is simply ignored."
    },
    {
      "question": "To diagnose an issue in a deployed Spring Boot application, you need to inspect all currently registered Spring beans and their types. Which Actuator endpoint would provide this detailed information?",
      "optionA": "`/actuator/env`",
      "optionB": "`/actuator/beans`",
      "optionC": "`/actuator/info`",
      "optionD": "`/actuator/configprops`",
      "answer": "`/actuator/beans`",
      "explanation": "The `/actuator/beans` endpoint provides a comprehensive list of all Spring beans loaded into the application context, including their types, scopes, and dependencies. Other endpoints serve different purposes: `/env` for environment properties, `/info` for general application information, and `/configprops` for beans annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties`."
