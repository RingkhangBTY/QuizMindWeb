      "optionC": "It simplifies initial setup and configuration through auto-configuration and 'opinionated' defaults.",
      "optionD": "It mandates the use of a specific database technology for all projects.",
      "answer": "It simplifies initial setup and configuration through auto-configuration and 'opinionated' defaults.",

      "optionC": "Copying an existing Spring Framework project and modifying it.",
      "optionD": "Writing all necessary configuration XML files from scratch.",
      "answer": "Using the Spring Initializr (e.g., via start.spring.io or IDE integration).",
      "explanation": "The Spring Initializr is the official and most efficient way to generate new Spring Boot projects. It allows developers to select project type (Maven/Gradle), Java version, desired dependencies, and then generates a ready-to-import project archive."
