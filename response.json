      "question": "What is the primary mechanism in Java OOP for bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, and restricting direct access to some of an object's components?",
      "optionA": "Polymorphism",
      "optionB": "Encapsulation",
      "optionC": "Inheritance",
      "optionD": "Abstraction",
      "answer": "Encapsulation",
      "explanation": "Encapsulation is the OOP principle of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit (a class), and hiding the internal state of the object from the outside world, usually by making fields private and providing public methods (getters/setters) for controlled access."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following keywords is used in Java to allow a class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class, promoting code reusability?",
      "optionA": "implements",
      "optionB": "uses",
      "optionC": "inherits",
      "optionD": "extends",
      "answer": "extends",
      "explanation": "The `extends` keyword in Java is specifically used to define an inheritance relationship, where a subclass inherits from a superclass, thereby reusing its methods and fields."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Java, having two or more methods in the same class with the same name but different argument lists (number, type, or order of parameters) is an example of what OOP concept?",
      "optionA": "Method Overriding",
      "optionB": "Data Hiding",
      "optionC": "Method Overloading",
      "optionD": "Abstraction",
      "answer": "Method Overloading",
      "explanation": "Method Overloading is a form of compile-time polymorphism where multiple methods in the same class have the same name but distinct parameter lists. Method Overriding involves a subclass providing a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main purpose of an abstract class in Java?",
      "optionA": "To create objects directly from it.",
      "optionB": "To define a common interface for a group of related classes, potentially with some default implementations, but not allowing direct instantiation.",
      "optionC": "To prevent any other class from extending it.",
      "optionD": "To force all its methods to be declared as `static`.",
      "answer": "To define a common interface for a group of related classes, potentially with some default implementations, but not allowing direct instantiation.",
      "explanation": "An abstract class serves as a blueprint for other classes. It can have both abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) methods. Its primary purpose is to provide a common structure and partial implementation that subclasses must complete, and it cannot be instantiated directly."

    {
      "question": "Consider a `Car` class. When we create `Car myCar = new Car();`, what does `myCar` represent in terms of OOP principles?",
      "optionA": "A blueprint for creating vehicles.",
      "optionB": "An interface that defines car behavior.",
      "optionC": "An instance of the `Car` class, also known as an object.",
      "optionD": "A static utility method.",
      "answer": "An instance of the `Car` class, also known as an object.",
      "explanation": "A class (`Car`) is a blueprint, and an object (`myCar`) is a concrete instance created from that blueprint. So, `myCar` is an object of the `Car` class."
