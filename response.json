      "optionD": "(1, 99, 4)",
      "answer": "(1, [99, 3], 4)",
      "explanation": "Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change which objects they refer to directly (e.g., `t[0] = 5` would raise a TypeError). However, if a tuple contains a mutable object (like a list in this case), the mutable object itself can be modified. Here, `t[1]` refers to the list `[2, 3]`, and `t[1][0] = 99` modifies an element within that list, which is a valid operation. The tuple `t` still refers to the same list object, but the internal state of that list object has changed."

      "optionD": "TypeError: 'generator' object is not subscriptable",
      "answer": "First: [0, 1], Second: []",
      "explanation": "The `count_up_to` function is a generator. When `gen_one = count_up_to(2)` is called, it creates a generator object. The list comprehension `[x for x in gen_one]` iterates through `gen_one`, consuming its values (0 and 1) until it's exhausted. Once a generator is exhausted, it cannot produce more values unless a new generator object is created. Although `gen_two = count_up_to(2)` creates a *new* generator, `second_values` attempts to iterate over the *already exhausted* `gen_one` again, thus resulting in an empty list. So, `first_values` will be `[0, 1]` and `second_values` will be `[]`."
